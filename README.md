The `rcdf` package is a comprehensive toolkit for securely working with
RCDF (encrypted Parquet) files in R. RCDF is a custom data format
designed to provide strong encryption and metadata management for
sensitive datasets. With `rcdf`, users can easily handle encrypted data,
including reading, writing, and exporting data stored in this secure
format.

Key features include:

- **Secure data handling**: Functions for reading and writing encrypted
  Parquet files using AES and RSA encryption.
- **Metadata management**: Tools for handling and storing metadata in
  RCDF files, including automated key generation and decryption.
- **Parquet integration**: Full integration with the `arrow` package to
  read and write Parquet files seamlessly.
- **Cross-platform support**: Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows
  environments.
