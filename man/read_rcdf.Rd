\title{Read and Decrypt RCDF Data}
\usage{
read_rcdf(path, decryption_key, ..., password = NULL, metadata = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A string specifying the path to the RCDF archive (zip file).}

\item{decryption_key}{The key used to decrypt the RCDF contents. This can be an RSA or AES key, depending on how the RCDF was encrypted.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to other functions, if needed.}

\item{password}{A password used for RSA decryption (optional).}

\item{metadata}{An optional metadata object containing data dictionaries and value sets. This metadata is applied to the data if provided.}
}
\value{
An RCDF object, which is a list of Parquet files (one for each record) along with attached metadata.
}
\description{
This function reads an RCDF (Reusable Data Container Format) archive, decrypts its contents using the specified decryption key,
and loads it into R as an RCDF object. The data files within the archive (usually Parquet files) are decrypted and, if provided,
metadata (such as data dictionary and value sets) are applied to the data.
